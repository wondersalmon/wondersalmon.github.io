## My skills
##### I am in the process of learning. I am currently studying:
- [Docker]
- [Ansible]
- [Git] & [GitLab CI/CD]
- [k8s]
- [Terraform]
- [Prometheus]
##### I am also updating my knowledge in:
- [Linux] - I use Arch Linux at home and in projects
- [Bash]  - Practice writing scripts
- [Database] - I've dealt with PostgreSQL and MySQL before
- [Network]  - Knowing networks helped me a lot in my old job.


Now I want to change the type of activity and improve my skills, so I'm looking for the position of junior devops engineer. Stay tuned.
